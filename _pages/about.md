Haidian District, Beijing, China, 100083.

About me
======

I am a Researcher of at China Telecom Cloud Technology Co., Ltd. My research interests span the areas of program analysis, distributed systems, and computer graphics. The goal of my research is to bring more reliability and security to the world of distributed systems.

I received my Ph.D. from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications working with Prof. Hua Zhang in 2021,
and my bachelor's in School of Computer Science at Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications in 2014.

I am very lucky to work with Prof [Linhai Song](https://songlh.github.io/) during my visit at College of Information Sciences and Technology, The Pennsylvania State University (2018.10-2021.01). Not only did I learn a lot about program analysis from Prof Song, but also the skills and attitudes towards academic research. He is an outstanding and fruitful associated professor who deserves your attention.

Mentored by Prof Song, I am honored to be the first author of *Understanding and Detecting Real-World Safety Issues in Rust* and *Algorithmic Profiling for Real-World Complexity Problems* published in TSE and the co-first author with Yilun Chen of *Understanding Memory and Thread Safety Practices and Issues in Real-World Rust Programs* published in PLDI'20.
